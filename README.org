* clojure-training-2024

A set of training materials (based on https://github.com/alain-picard/clojure-training) prepared by Benson Zhang for use in training new clojure engineers at Blue Ridge Global.

* How to use this repo

*PREPARING*

Before each lesson, you /must/ come prepared by having
completed the necessary reading in each of the [[Lesson Plans]].
Make sure you keep an eye on this repo for new lesson plans,
and I will email you all each time a new one is added.

*DURING THE LESSONS*

This repo will periodically be updated with the code developed in
each lesson (when applicable) so you can download and play with the
examples I provide during the lessons.  Jack will also record the
lessons and make the videos available to you all.
After each lesson, the code will be added in a
file (or subdirectory) named =lesson-01=, =lesson-02= /etc./ (in the src subdir).

*AFTER THE LESSONS*

You will have to *fork* this repo so you can submit your *assignment solutions*
for review.

At the end of the lesson, I will sometimes set assignments
which I will detail in the [[Assignments]] section.  You should
attempt to answer these, placing your answers in the file
=/src/assignments/your_name//lesson_XX_answers.clj=.  When you
can cleanly load your file into a repl, raise a *pull request* for
me to review your code and merge it back into the main repo.  Thus,
you'll be able to view your colleague's solutions after I merge your
answers back into the main repo.

*REVIEWING SOLUTIONS*

After the lessons, I will place my solutions in [[file:src/assignments/alain/][this directory]]. You
can peruse them at your leisure and compare against the code
you have written.

I will also place the code I present during the live coding
sessions [[file:src/clojure_training/][in here]]; the files beginning with live_XXX are the code
you see on the screen during the presentation; the files without the
live_ prefix are the preparatory material I produce (which is close,
but doesn't include the tangents I go off on during the lessons as
questions arise, /etc./)

Pull this branch separately, and merge it into your source branch, commit, and raise a pull request to the main branch.

** Lesson 2
   These are the assignment problems following Lesson 2.
   We will discuss your solutions and see my solutions
   at the beginning of [[file:doc/lesson-03.org::*Lesson%20Goals][Lesson 3]].

   1. Implement your own version of =filter= using a loop form, then using reduce.
   2. Implement your own version of =update-in=
   3. Write a function which solves this problem:
      https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/77
   4. Write a function which solves this problem:
      https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/53

** Lesson 3

   1. Read chapters 9 and 10 of [[https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/][Clojure for the Brave and True]]

   2. Listen to the this online talk: [[https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey/][Are we there yet]]
      Take notes!  Listen carefully!  Rich is a very deep thinker.
      Pay particular attention to the analogy about the baseball game,
      when he discusses how state evolves and should be modelled.
      Can you see why clojure has =atoms= and =refs=, and immutable values,
      as its programming model?

   3. Try to solve the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200701030903/http://www.4clojure.com/problem/178][best poker hand]]
      problem (The original is down so we will use an archived version).  This will require you
      to first solve problem 128, [[https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/128][recognizing poker hands]].
      This is an excercise is structuring and factoring your code
      as cleanly as possible; pay close attention to your representation
      and clearly separate the parsing code from the evaluation code.
      See what reusable functions exist in recognizing all the various
      types of hands.

      Here I want you to think not simply in terms of learning clojure syntax;
      (you should have all the necessary tools to solve this already), but
      at the next level of sophistication; that is, worry about
      - choosing good names for functions and variables

      - representation of your data structures

      - clearly separating out functionality

      - making things as readable and understandable as you possibly can

      - write a test harness for your code.

** Lesson 4

   1. There are no koans dealing with multiprocessing (probably just
      too hard to write them!)  So we'll be doing the book excercises
      instead.
      Do the exercises at the end of chapter 9.

   2. Do the exercises at the end of chapter 10.  Note that in the
      second excercise, the URL shown is incorrect; it should be HTTPS,
      not http, thus:
     #+begin_src clojure
(slurp "https://www.braveclojure.com/random-quote")
   #+end_src
      THIS SEEMS TO BE DOWN, create a function with a random delay of 1-3
      seconds instead and use that to simulate a delay.

   These exercises are longer and more challenging than the ones you have
   done so far.  Don't hesitate to reach out on the issues board!

** Lesson 5

 - Read chapter 6, specially the ns macro

 - write a unix-like grep command in clojure, so that, e.g.
 #+begin_src clojure
   (grep "/tmp/somefile.txt" regex)
   ;; =>
   ["match 1" "match 2" "..."]
 #+end_src

 - for extra difficulty, make it return a lazy sequence of
   matches instead.  What difficulties does this present?
   Which version is better/more useful? Can you implement
   the former in terms of the latter?  Discuss.

 - You now know >90% of clojure syntax and functions, so you
   should start exercising your newfound powers as much as possible.
   Practice makes perfect!  Here are some problem ideas for you to try:
   The Advent of code is always fun; the last 2 years had good problems.
   You can try to get as far as you can on these:
   - https://adventofcode.com/2018

   Solve as many of the [[https://4clojure.oxal.org][4 clojure]] problems as you can; they are arranged
   either by topic or difficulty.  Try those which you understand least!
   Don't be afraid to call out for help!
